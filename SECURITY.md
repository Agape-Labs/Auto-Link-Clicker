## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage you to report any security vulnerabilities you discover. To ensure the integrity of our users' security, please **do not** disclose vulnerabilities publicly or through public GitHub issues.

**Please report all vulnerabilities privately.**

2.  Under the repository name, click the **Security** tab.
3.  Click **Report a vulnerability** to open the advisory form.
