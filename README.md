## About The Project

**Auto Link Clicker** is a simple yet powerful browser automation tool designed to save you time. Instead of manually searching for and clicking the same link on multiple pages, this extension lets you specify the link's text, and it will programmatically click it for you on every open tab in your Chrome browser [3].

This is especially useful for users who perform repetitive tasks, test web pages, or navigate websites that have a consistent link structure across many pages.

### Built With
